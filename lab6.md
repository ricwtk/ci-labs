# Lab 6: ANN (Hyperplane)

## Artificial neural networks

### Objective
- to visualise the hyperplanes of a neural network configuration for better understanding

### Data

### Setup the first configuration for neural network

### Visualise the classification of a fitted model

### Setup the second, third, and more neural network configurations 

### Visualise result of all configurations

### Additional
There is a [tensorflow playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) which tries to visualise the training process of a neural network. It's similar to what we did in this lab.
